                        There really isn't much to say about myself. I'm a weird nerd, getting old. I'm not a huge fan of talking about myself, 
                        so for the rest of this about me, I will ramble. I do all sorts of things that most every other person does. I sleep at 
                        night, sometimes I wake up in the morning, sometimes I wake up in the afternoon. My skills include breathing: I literally 
                        do this everyday, sometimes I don't even notice I'm doing it. Ive been breathing my

                        This is a second paragraph ill be writing. I hope you like it, I made it myself. I'm slightly disappointed that I couldn't 
                        ramble on longer in the previous paragraph, but hopefully I can redeem myself with this one. I might even pepper in more facts 
                        about myself, who knows? I'll give you an easy one to start and see what happens. I am currently living in Kansas, but I have 
                        family in many different places scattered around the U.S., none in different countries, unfortunately. Ive got three sisters, 
                        one mother and one father. I was the only son to a father that was also an only son. If I were to die without having children 
                        my last name would die with me. My bloodline must continue in order for humanity to survive. That last line is a tagline for an 
                        HBO miniseries I literally just started working on as I typed it. I think this will suffice for a paragraph. I did more rambling,
                        I'm proud of myself, and if you actually read all of this mess of a paragraph; I'm proud of you too. Keep it up champ, I can 
                        only imagine it gets worse and or stupider from this point.
